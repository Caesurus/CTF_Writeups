# PicoCTF 2024

I have placed a collection of exploits here. I haven't bothered doing writeups on some of the easier challenges since they were very straight forward. If there is anyone out there that is confused about any of those, please feel free to reach out. You can open an issue in the repo. I'm all about helping people learn.


That said, there were a couple of really fun challenges this year that I thought were worth write-ups:
- General Skills Category
    - [SansAlpha](./GEN-SansAlpha/readme.md)
- Binary Exploitation
    - [babygame03](./PWN-babygame03/readme.md)

And then that brings us to the one that wasn't necessarily *"fun"* because it took up an exorbitant amount of my time this year. 

But I relish the challenge and it was a well thought out challenge that honestly taught me a lot. That challenge was: 
- Binary Exploitation
    - [High Frequency Trouble](./PWN-HighFrequencyTroubles/readme.md)
